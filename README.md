# firstReactApp
# First application using React Native

### I wanted to make a list of images that would be thumbnails that the user can tap on and go to another page to get more information 

### I made a react component with images and text and then imported that to App.js

## Issues 
### I have issues with the scroll view, was not able to keep the images with in the 'safe zone' for ios 
### The styles for the header could not be applied for some reason

## Wanted to add
### I wanted to add a bottom tab bar navigator so I can have another page with a fun beach ball game, for some reason I encountered many erroes so I decided to not pursue that right now for the sake of time and I will learn more about navigation in class. 

## modified to have animations 
#### added a spring, fade and rotate animation

### make sure to npm install within the project and have the expo cli installed in your root derectory
